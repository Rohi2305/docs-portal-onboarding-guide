=======================================================
Log in to the Rackspace Technology customer portal
=======================================================

When you become a Rackspace Technology customer, we provide you with access
to customer portals for managing your cloud accounts.
These portals are different for
`Public Cloud <https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public>`_
and `Private Cloud <https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private>`_ customers.

The account registration code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rackspace Technology uses an account registration code
to verify new users. When an account
administrator adds you as a user, you receive
an email with your account registration code
and instructions on how to log in to the
`Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <login.rackspace.com>`_
for the first time.
You need this registration code only during your
first login or if you forget your user name.

The primary contact on the account is the only person
who can change this code. When the primary contact
adds a user, the user receives a registration code.

If you are the primary contact on the account and
you forget the code or need to reset your login,
contact your account manager or Rackspace Technology Support.


The global navigation menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although the Rackspace Technology customer portal is different for
`Public Cloud <https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public>`_
and `Private Cloud <https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private>`_ customers,
both portals include a global navigation menu that
allows you to complete common tasks easily.

To access the global navigation menu:

#. Log in to the `Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <login.rackspace.com>`_.
#. Select from the global navigation dropdown menu items.
