Manage public cloud users and user groups
=========================================

Create a new user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following steps to create a new user:

#. Log in to the `Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <login.rackspace.com>`_.

#. Select **Account > User Management** from the global navigation menu.

#. Select **Create New User**.

#. Enter the new user information.

#. Select **Create New User**.

If you are a Rackspace Technology Public Cloud customer, you can
also leverage user groups to manage your users and permissions. By
grouping users together and assigning permissions to the group,
you can adjust access for all users in the group at once,
rather than adding or revoking access permission for each user individually.

.. note::

     Private cloud accounts do not have user groups.

Create a user group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps to create a user group:

#. Log in to the `Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <login.rackspace.com>`_.

#. Select **Account > User Management** from the global navigation menu.

#. Select the **User Group** tab.

#. Select **Create New User Group**.

#. Enter a Group Name and a longer description for Group Description.

#. Select **Create Group**.


Add and remove group members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove a user from a group, clear the checkbox next to their name.

To add a new member or edit an existing member,
select **Add/Edit Members** and make your changes.

.. note::

     If you add a user to a group that has greater permissions than they originally had,
     the lesser permissions are disabled.
