Account switcher limitations
=============================

The Account Switcher feature has the following limitations.

- Support cannot verify you over the phone for linked accounts.

- Ticketing information is only visible for the account that you are currently
  accessing. Use the account switcher
  dropdown to change to the account for which you want to view tickets.

- The notifications section will always display notifications
  for all linked accounts. Notifications will include the account number
  to allow you sort between different linked accounts.
