Account switcher
=================

.. note::

   This feature is currently in beta and is only available for Fanatical Amazon Web Services (FAWS) customers
   who use `Rackspace Technology Identity Federation <https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/rackspace-federation/>`_
   to access their accounts.

The Account switcher feature simplifies the account management
process by making it easy to quickly
log in and out of multiple accounts. Account switcher helps large
enterprise customers with sprawling
relationships and Federated Identity management to streamline their workflow.

Domain trust
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Account switching uses domain trust to create an agreement that allows a principal
account to access a delegate account. Members of the principal account
can log into the `Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <https://login.rackspace.com>`_
and use the account linking dropdown
to navigate to connected delegate accounts.

Contact your customer support manager to request access to Account switcher.
