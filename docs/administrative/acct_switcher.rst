The Account switcher feature simplifies the account management
process by making it easy to quickly
log in and out of multiple accounts. Use this feature to log into
the Rackspace customer portal and then navigate to other accounts
using the account switcher dropdown.

Account switcher is an easy way for large
enterprise customers with sprawling
relationship across many different cloud accounts to manage these accounts.
Customers who fit this criteria and use
Rackspace Federated Identity to access the cloud portal can access to this feature.
