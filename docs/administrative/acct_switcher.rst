.. note::

   This feature is currently in beta and is only available for Fanatical Amazon Web Services (FAWS) customers
   who use `Rackspace Technology Identity Federation <https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/rackspace-federation/>`_
   to access their accounts.

The Account switcher feature simplifies the account management
process by making it easy to quickly
quickly switch which Rackspace account the user is currently working within.
Account switcher helps large
enterprise customers with sprawling
relationships and Federated Identity management to streamline their workflow.

Account linking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Account Linking may occur after multiple accounts are
linked together via an agreement. In this model, users
from a delegate Rackspace account may be granted access
to resources in a principal Rackspace account. Members of the principal account
can log into the `Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <https://login.rackspace.com>`_
and use the account linking dropdown
to navigate to connected delegate accounts.

Contact your customer support manager to request access to Account switcher.
