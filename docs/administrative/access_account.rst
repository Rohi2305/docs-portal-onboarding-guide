Get access to Account switcher
===============================

The Account switcher feature is not available for all customers.

Complete the following steps to gain access to the Account Switcher feature:

#. Contact your Customer Support Manager (CSM).

   Your CSM will help you to determine if your account is compatible
   with the account switcher feature.

#. Complete the legal agreement document and attach it to a
   support ticket. This document requires information
   about the accounts you plan to link together.
   You will receive a notification once the account linking
   is complete.

#. Log into the Rackspace Technology customer portal. Use the account switcher drop-down
   to switch between linked accounts.
