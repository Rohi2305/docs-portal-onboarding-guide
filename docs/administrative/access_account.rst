Get access to Account switcher
===============================

The Account switcher feature is only available for Fanatical Amazon Web Services (FAWS) customers
who use `Rackspace Technology Identity Federation <https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/rackspace-federation/>`_
to access their accounts..

Complete the following steps to gain access to the Account Switcher feature:

#. Contact your Customer Support Manager (CSM).

   Your CSM will help you to determine if your account is compatible
   with the account switcher feature.

#. Complete the legal agreement document and attach it to a
   support ticket. This document requires information
   about the accounts you plan to link.
   You will receive a notification once the account linking
   is complete.

#. Log into the `Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <https://login.rackspace.com>`_. Use the account switcher drop-down
   to switch to delegate accounts.

   Ticketing information is only visible for the account that you are currently
   accessing. Use the account switcher
   dropdown to change to the account for which you want to view tickets.

   The notifications section will always display notifications
   for all linked accounts. Notifications will include the account number
   to allow you sort between different linked accounts.

.. note::

    Support cannot verify you over the phone for linked accounts.
