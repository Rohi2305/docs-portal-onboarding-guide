.. note::

     Deactivating a user only removes their access to MyRackspace.
     Access to any devices under your account are not affected.
     The deactivated user still receives ticket update emails
     and can call Rackspace for support.
     If you need to delete a user on your account entirely,
     you can do so from the user's details page.
     A deleted user cannot call
     Rackspace for support or get any
     information about your account.
