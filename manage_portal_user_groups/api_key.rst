Manage your API key
===================

You can manage your Rackspace Technology assets with an Application
Programmer Interface (API). Review
`the catalog of Rackspace Technology APIs <https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/>`_
for more information.

To begin using Rackspace APIs, you need your API key. Your API key is a unique
alphanumeric identifier associated with your account.
You can use it for universal authentication commands for all of your services.

     the new API key in your application. If you are using your API key as a part of server
     code with a site or application, the site or application also breaks. Update
     your API key for any application to which you connected with the previous API key.
