===================================
Change your cloud account owner
===================================

You might need to change the primary user, also known as the account owner,
when a user leaves the company or the company or
project name changes. Update this information for
your Rackspace Technology Cloud and Amazon Web Services® (AWS)
accounts through
the `Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <login.rackspace.com>`_.

.. note::

      Only the current account owner can assign a new account owner.

When you change the account owner:

- You must select the new or promoted user
  from existing users on the account. The selected
  user becomes the primary contact and has full control over the account.

- As the former or demoted primary user, you are set
  up as an Administrative contact type and given
  basic `Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  Identity permissions <https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/cloud-identity/v2/getting-started/>`_.
  The primary user might need to set up
  RBAC permissions for the demoted user, depending on the use case.


Complete the following steps to change the account owner:

#. Log in to the `Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <login.rackspace.com>`_.

#. Select **Account** > **Account Settings** from the global navigation menu.

#. Select **Update** next to the Account Owner.

#. Select the radio button for the user
   that you want to assign as the new account owner.

#. Add the account owner’s address and select **Submit**.

#. When prompted to confirm the account update,
   type **CONFIRM** in the text box and select **Complete**.
